# Contributing to Focus/Klar for Android

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to 🔥 🦊 Focus/Klar! 🎉 👍  

## Filing bugs

* 📱 Please include the Android device and Android version you are using 
* 🌐 Posting [your user agent](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=my+user+agent) can
  help us debug problems.
* 📓 Include a list of steps to reproduce the issue
* 🔬 State what behavior you expected and what the actual behavior is on your
  device

## Writing code

* Start by looking for issues marked with the [`good first issue`
  label](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/labels/good%20first%20issue)
* You can find more challenging issues marked with the [`help wanted`
  label](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/labels/help%20wanted)
* Join the #focus channel on [irc.mozilla.org](https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC)
  and get in contact with us. We're available Monday-Friday, during GMT and PST
working hours.
* Comment on the issue if you would like to work on it.
* If you want to work on a new feature then always file an issue first so that
  all teams (product, ux, engineering) can comment on it and so that it can be
assigned to a milestone. **Pull requests for unsolicited features are unlikely
to get merged.**
* When you open a pull request, please also include a screenshot if there are
  UI changes, so UX can also do a visual review.
* Include a `Closes #<issue-number>` as part of your first commit message so
  it's auto-linked to the issue.

## Translating the app

* Get in touch with the [existing localization
  team](https://wiki.mozilla.org/L10n:Teams).
* Localization happens on
  [Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/projects/focus-for-android/).

## Testing the app

* Download Focus and test the app. Or [sign up to get beta
  builds](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/wiki/Beta) from
Google Play.
* File [new issues](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues) for
  all bugs you encounter. Make sure that an issue isn't filed already (via the
search).
* Make sure that your bug report contains: Android version, device name, exact
  steps to reproduce the issue, a description of what you expect and what
actually happens.
* Try to reproduce issues reported by others and add additional or missing
  information to the bug reports.
