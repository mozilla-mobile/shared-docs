There are tons of resources for learning Android and Kotlin available, and sifting through all of them can be daunting. Because of this, our team has compiled some resources we found particularly helpful. Below are our recommendations for getting up to speed on Android and Kotlin! 

# Learning Android ðŸ“š

### [Google's Udacity Course: Developing Android Apps](https://www.udacity.com/course/new-android-fundamentals--ud851)
This course is perfect if you have a solid understanding of Java but little experience with mobile development. However, it fails to mention helpful third-party libraries that are frequently used.

### [Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide](https://www.bignerdranch.com/books/android-programming/)
Another great foundational resource for learning Android. Since it's not provided directly by Google it includes more third-party library examples.

### [Google I/O](https://events.google.com/io/recap/)
Watching the most recent Google I/O's and their codelabs is perfect for getting a quick overview of what's new in Android.

# Learning Kotlin ðŸ“–

### [Google's Udacity Course: Kotlin for Android Developers](https://www.udacity.com/course/kotlin-for-android-developers--ud888)

This course assumes you have a solid understanding of Android app development, and is great if you want to learn Kotlin specifically for this purpose.


### [Kotlin Koans](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/koans.html)

These exercises will walk you through the features of Kotlin, testing your knowledge along the way. This resource has been utilized frequently by our team.

### [Kotlin in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/kotlin-in-action)

This book provides a great overview of the language, but does not cover everything (e.g. co-routines), so use as a reference sparingly.

### [Swift is like Kotlin](http://nilhcem.com/swift-is-like-kotlin/)

This site provides a ton of examples of how Swift code looks in Kotlin. If you're comfortable with Swift (or moving from iOS development) this is a great resource for you!

### [Kotlin Documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/)

A good reference to always have handy. The official Kotlin documentation.
