## Getting started
Assuming you already have some coding experience, Google's official [Developing Android Apps udacity course][udacity course] comes highly recommended by our team. After completing your first few lessons, you can try to working on our code base, continuing the course as necessary.

Once you have a little experience, the beginner's guides in the [official Android developer docs][devdocs] teach popular topics pretty well and are a good reference. However, they aren't very good at telling you where to go next (which is why we recommended the course). Note: the documentation on less popular topics are often missing information.

There are also many good Android tips and conference talks on YouTube.
