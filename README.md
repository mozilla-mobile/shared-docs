# mozilla-mobile Shared Documentation
This repository is intended to host documentation that doesn't fit into a single mozilla-mobile repository. You can quickly access this page at the following URL:

https://mozilla-mobile.github.io/docs.html

The mozilla-mobile repository is primarily managed by two teams at Mozilla:
- Firefox for iOS team
- Android Product Team (APT)
